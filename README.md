# dat510-assignment1

### Setup and installation
The assignemnt was solved using JavaScript and Node.js. To be able to run the programs, Node.js need to be installed.
Download and install Node.js using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
The installer should add Node.js to your path. To check that your installation completed successfully you can run
> node -v
to print the current version of Node.js installed on the machine.

Depending on the operating system you are using, the dependencies requried may or may not work out of the box. 
If you are having issues with any of the dependencies I recommend deleting the "node_modules" folder and running:
> npm install 
this will reinstall all packages the project depends on.

Your shold now be ready to run the code.

### Running the code


> node vigenere/index // Will decrypt the poly-alphabetic sustitution cipher given in task 1
> node vigenere/index --verbose=true // Will print results of Index of Coinsidens and Chi-squared statistic calculations, in addition to the normal output
